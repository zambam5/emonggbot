The cfgai file contains all account information you need to run this.
For the PASS, I used https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to generate the token

The giftcounts.txt file is to generate a dictionary with twitch user IDs as keys
so I don't feel comfortable giving it out

I have no idea what I'm doing here so if I missed anything let me know :)

Update:
Added spotify functionality using spotipy. To get a token use get_token.py and follow the link.
It will cache the token needed to run the main bot.
